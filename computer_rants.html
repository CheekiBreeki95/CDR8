  <h1> Welcome to my computer rant page! This is where all computer rants I make will be posted.</h1>
  <h3>Used Computers</h3>
   <p> First rant, this one is about used computers that are broken or just unused but people throw them out or keep them. I get keeping them if there still working or important but if its just broken, GIVE IT AWAY, I've had this problem a few times where there is just computers sitting unplugged and unused give it away! If its broken sell it on <a ebay.co.uk /a>
    eBay as spares and repairs. Surely someone can find a use for it, whether they fix it or use it for spares or even repair it! </p> 
	   <p> Rant over. </p>
